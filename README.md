# Get into AI

With this examples you can get an intuition about what AI could do today and were it is heading.

Also I proved some starting point to build such system your self. When I started me journey
into AI about a your ago I struggled on were to start, because I thought AI is such advanced
topic that only scientists could do it. With this Repo I want to show you that everybody has the possibility so build such systems.
